pre processing

* first combine the names in to the data file and save it as a csv 
* theres a error in the first attribute in the name file it mentions that there are values (1-5) but theres a 55 as a value and i corrected
it to 5.
* for the missing values use the filter replace missing values
* then for the age use discretizer filter and classify the age into 3 bins and to a nominal dataset
* convert all the other fields to nominal using numeric to nominal fiter

rule mining

* apply apriori with 0.8 confidence with 10 rules and i got some good rules with 1.9 lift value that means those attributes are more 
correlated
* again apply the apriori with 0.7 metric with 20 rules
